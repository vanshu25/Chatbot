# Chatbot

I created conversational chatbot using Intent Recognition Dataset from Kaggle.

__TechStack:__ PyTorch, NLP, NumPy, Python


* Intent.json is the data file from Kaggle here that is being used for the chatbot.

* nltk_utils.py is the python file where the code for pre-processing the data is written. I have written code for tokenization, stemming and bag-of-words using nltk and NumPy.

* model.py is the python file in which the model is created. It is a simple Feed Forward Neural Network with two hidden layers.

* train.py is the file where I have actually trained the model and chat.py is the python file where the actual chatbot has been implemented.


Here is the screenshot of working of the chatbot:
